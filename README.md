# ControlNet-Sketch-To-Image
Sketch an image and generate a Stable Diffusion image from it using ControlNet Scribble.

The ControlNet Sketch To Image desktop client is a powerful UI for creating images using Stable Diffusion and ControlNet Scribble. Pass it a sketch and get back a Stable Diffusion generated image.

Built with [Delphi](https://www.embarcadero.com/products/delphi/) using the FireMonkey framework this client works on Windows, macOS, and Linux (and maybe Android+iOS) with a single codebase and single UI. At the moment it is specifically set up for Windows.

It also features a REST integration with Replicate.com for providing Generate Image functionality within the client. You need to sign up for an API key to access that functionality.
